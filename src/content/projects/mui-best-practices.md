Material-UI provides a comprehensive set of React components that implement Google's Material Design system. Here are some best practices for getting the most out of MUI.

## Theme Customization

Always start with a custom theme to ensure consistency across your application:

```jsx
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#1976d2',
    },
  },
});
```

## Component Patterns

* Use the `sx` prop for one-off styling
* Create custom components for repeated patterns
* Leverage the theme breakpoints for responsive design
* Always consider accessibility in your component design

## Performance Tips

* Use tree shaking to only import what you need
* Consider using `@mui/lab` for experimental components
* Optimize bundle size with proper imports
